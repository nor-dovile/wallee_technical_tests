## Target website

https://woocommerce.showcase-wallee.com/

## About my approach

My first step was to do a **explaratory testing** which consisted in explorin the page and finding immediatly some bugs, without neccesarely looking at the acceptance criteria.

My second step is the use the **acceptance criteria** as a guiding reference for the design of the test cases. So all test cases are grouped by specific functionalities.

After finishing writing all test cases, I assigned a **priority** based on the acceptance criteria, trying to put as Critical the ones that are crucial to make the webpage work: 

> The user should be able to navigate, add a product to the cart, be able to go through the process of checkout, creating and account and  make a final payment.

## Future work

After bugs are fixed and the development team deploys new updates, I would take a time to dive into **regression testing**, which is out of the scope of this project.

## About test cases and bugs

I wrote and prioritized a list of test cases that can be found in [test cases](TEST_CASES.md)

All the bugs I found on the website https://woocommerce.showcase-wallee.com/ can be browsed on this [repository](https://github.com/nor-dovile/wallee_technical_tests/issues)
